<!-- # Lesson: Feature Engineering -->
## Learning Outcomes
  
Upon completion of this lesson, you will be able to:
  
- Students will grasp the significance of feature engineering in the machine learning pipeline and its role in improving model performance.
- Students will learn various preprocessing techniques such as  scaling features and encoding categorical variables to prepare the data for modeling
