<!-- # Lesson: Imbalanced -->
## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this lesson, you will be able to:
  
- Improved model performance: By addressing class imbalance effectively, machine learning models can achieve better performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and overall predictive power.
- Reduced bias and discrimination: Addressing class imbalance helps in reducing bias and discrimination that may arise from models trained on imbalanced datasets.
