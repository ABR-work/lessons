<!-- # Lesson: Error Handling -->

Upon completion of this lesson, you will be able to:
  
- Implement error handling techniques in Python to handle and respond to runtime errors.
- Use the try-except-else-finally structure to handle exceptions gracefully and handle errors in a controlled manner.
- Raise exceptions when necessary to indicate that an error has occurred.
- Catch and handle specific exceptions using the except clause.
- Use multiple except clauses to handle different types of exceptions.
- Finally, you will be able to improve the robustness and reliability of your code by implementing appropriate error handling techniques.
