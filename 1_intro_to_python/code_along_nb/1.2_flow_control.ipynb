    "  - `if` is used to check a condition and execute a block of code if it's true.\n",

    "  - `else` provides a default block of code to execute if none of the previous conditions are true.\n",

    "- `for` loops for iterating over a sequence:\n",
    "  - `for` loops execute a block of code for each item in a sequence or iterable object.\n",

    "- `while` loops for repeated execution:\n",
