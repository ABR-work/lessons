Upon completion of this lesson, you will be able to:
  
- Understand the key concepts of object-oriented programming, such as classes, objects, attributes, and methods, and how they relate to Python programming.
- Use Python classes and objects to build solutions that leverage the power of object-oriented programming.
- Create classes and objects.
- Utilize class attributes and methods to define the behavior of objects and control their interactions with other objects and the environment.
