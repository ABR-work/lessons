<!-- # Integrating Python with MySQL -->

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Set up a connection between Python and a MySQL database using the `mysql-connector-python` package.
- Execute SQL queries in Python.
- Fetch and manipulate data in Python after querying from MySQL.
- Handle database errors and exceptions in Python.

## Setting up the Connection

Before you can interact with MySQL using Python, you need to establish a connection to the database. The `mysql-connector-python` module provides the necessary tools for this.

### Installation:

To install the `mysql-connector-python` package:

```python
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

### Connecting to MySQL:

```python
import mysql.connector

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="your_host",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    database="your_database"
)

cursor = conn.cursor()
```

## Executing SQL Queries

With the connection set up and a cursor object created, you can now execute SQL queries.

### Basic Syntax:

```python
cursor.execute("YOUR SQL QUERY HERE")
```

**Example**:

To fetch all rows from a table named `employees`:

```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
result = cursor.fetchall()
for row in result:
    print(row)
```

## Data Manipulation in Python

Once you have fetched data, you can manipulate it like any other Python data.

### Fetching Specific Data:

```python
cursor.execute("SELECT employee_name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000")
high_salary_employees = cursor.fetchall()
```

### Inserting Data:

```python
sql = "INSERT INTO employees (employee_name, salary) VALUES (%s, %s)"
val = ("John Doe", 55000)
cursor.execute(sql, val)
conn.commit()
```

## Handling Errors and Exceptions

When working with databases, it's essential to handle errors and exceptions to ensure data integrity and application stability.

### Basic Syntax:

```python
try:
    cursor.execute("YOUR SQL QUERY HERE")
except mysql.connector.Error as err:
    print(f"Error: {err}")
finally:
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
```

## Closing the Connection

After executing your queries and fetching the necessary data, always remember to close the cursor and the connection to free up resources.

```python
cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

## Summary

Integrating Python with MySQL allows for powerful data processing and manipulation. With the `mysql-connector-python` module, you can seamlessly transition between SQL databases and Python applications. Whether you're building data-driven applications, conducting data analysis, or automating database tasks, understanding how to combine Python with MySQL is a valuable skill in the modern data landscape.
