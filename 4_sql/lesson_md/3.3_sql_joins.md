<!-- # SQL Joins -->

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand different types of joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN), RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN), and FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN).
- Retrieve data from multiple tables based on common columns.
- Use the `ON` clause to specify conditions for the join.
- Utilize aliases for tables and columns.
- Combine joins with other SQL clauses like `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY`.

## Introduction to Joins

SQL joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. This allows us to perform queries that retrieve information from multiple tables in a single query.

A `JOIN` operation merges rows from two tables based on matching values in specified columns. Typically, one table possesses a `primary key`, a unique identifier for its rows. The counterpart table contains a column (or columns) that reference. This referencing column is termed a `foreign key`. The crux of the `JOIN` lies in the equality between the primary key of one table and the corresponding foreign key in the other.

## INNER JOIN

The `INNER JOIN` keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

### **Example**

Given two tables, `orders` with columns `order_id`, `product_id`, and `quantity`, and `products` with columns `product_id`, `product_name`, and `price`.

**Table `products`**:

| product_id | product_name | price  |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| 1          | Laptop       | 1000   |
| 2          | Mouse        | 20     |
| 3          | Keyboard     | 50     |
| 4          | Monitor      | 200    |



**Table `orders`**:

| order_id | product_id | quantity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| 101      | 1          | 3        |
| 102      | 3          | 5        |
| 103      | 4          | 2        |

To retrieve the name of the product and the quantity ordered:

```sql
SELECT products.product_name, orders.quantity
FROM orders
INNER JOIN products
ON orders.product_id = products.product_id;
```

**Resulting Set**:

| product_name | quantity |
|--------------|----------|
| Laptop       | 3        |
| Keyboard     | 5        |
| Monitor      | 2        |

## LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)

The `LEFT JOIN` keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matched records from the right table (table2). The result is NULL for the right side when there is no match.

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

### **Example**

We'll continue with the same two tables, we'll show them here again for better understanding of the lesson.

**Table `products`**:

| product_id | product_name | price  |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| 1          | Laptop       | 1000   |
| 2          | Mouse        | 20     |
| 3          | Keyboard     | 50     |
| 4          | Monitor      | 200    |



**Table `orders`**:

| order_id | product_id | quantity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| 101      | 1          | 3        |
| 102      | 3          | 5        |
| 103      | 4          | 2        |

To retrieve all products and their corresponding order quantities (including products that haven't been ordered):

```sql
SELECT products.product_name, orders.quantity
FROM products
LEFT JOIN orders
ON products.product_id = orders.product_id;
```

**Resulting Set**:

| product_name | quantity |
|--------------|----------|
| Laptop       | 3        |
| Mouse        | NULL     |
| Keyboard     | 5        |
| Monitor      | 2        |


## RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

The `RIGHT JOIN` keyword, not as commonly used, returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matched records from the left table (table1). The result is NULL for the left side when there is no match.

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

### Example

We'll continue with the same two tables, we'll show them here again for better understanding of the lesson.

**Table `products`**:

| product_id | product_name | price  |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| 1          | Laptop       | 1000   |
| 2          | Mouse        | 20     |
| 3          | Keyboard     | 50     |
| 4          | Monitor      | 200    |



**Table `orders`**:

| order_id | product_id | quantity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| 101      | 1          | 3        |
| 102      | 3          | 5        |
| 103      | 4          | 2        |


(Note: The RIGHT JOIN is less commonly used since it's essentially the same as a LEFT JOIN but with the tables reversed.)

To retrieve the name of the product and the quantity ordered, including orders for which products don't exist:

```sql
SELECT products.product_name, orders.quantity
FROM products
RIGHT JOIN orders
ON products.product_id = orders.product_id;
```

**Resulting Set**:

| product_name | quantity |
|--------------|----------|
| Laptop       | 3        |
| Keyboard     | 5        |
| Monitor      | 2        |



## FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)

The `FULL JOIN` keyword returns all records when there's a match in one of the tables. This means it returns all rows from both tables and puts NULL in the columns from the table that doesnâ€™t have a match.

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

**Note**: Not all database systems support `FULL JOIN`. For instance, MySQL doesn't, but you can achieve similar results using a combination of LEFT and RIGHT JOINs.

### Example

We'll continue with the same two tables, we'll show them here again for better understanding of the lesson.

**Table `products`**:

| product_id | product_name | price  |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| 1          | Laptop       | 1000   |
| 2          | Mouse        | 20     |
| 3          | Keyboard     | 50     |
| 4          | Monitor      | 200    |



**Table `orders`**:

| order_id | product_id | quantity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| 101      | 1          | 3        |
| 102      | 3          | 5        |
| 103      | 4          | 2        |

To retrieve all products and their corresponding order quantities, regardless of whether the product has been ordered or an order doesn't have a corresponding product:

```sql
SELECT products.product_name, orders.quantity
FROM products
FULL JOIN orders
ON products.product_id = orders.product_id;
```

**Resulting Set**:

| product_name | quantity |
|--------------|----------|
| Laptop       | 3        |
| Mouse        | NULL     |
| Keyboard     | 5        |
| Monitor      | 2        |


## Using Aliases with Joins

Aliases can be used to give a table or a column a temporary name, making columns and table names more readable.

**Example**:

Given our previous tables, `orders` and `products`:

```sql
SELECT p.product_name, o.quantity
FROM products AS p
INNER JOIN orders AS o
ON p.product_id = o.product_id;
```

Here, `p` is an alias for the `products` table and `o` is an alias for the `orders` table.

## Combining Joins with Other SQL Commands

Joins can be combined with `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY` clauses to create more complex queries.

### **Example**

To retrieve the total quantity ordered for each product, sorted by product name:

```sql
SELECT p.product_name, SUM(o.quantity) as total_quantity
FROM products AS p
LEFT JOIN orders AS o
ON p.product_id = o.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY p.product_name;
```

**Resulting Set**:

| product_name | total_quantity |
|--------------|----------------|
| Keyboard     | 5              |
| Laptop       | 3              |
| Monitor      | 2              |
| Mouse        | NULL           |
