## **Practice with SQL Queries**

Use MySQL (or your preferred SQL client) to access the 'bank' database, which will serve as the foundation for our upcoming examples.

Once you've successfully connected to MySQL and opened the database, proceed to open and examine [this SQL file with queries](https://github.com/data-bootcamp-v4/lessons/blob/main/4_sql/3.4_sql_subqueries.sql). It contains a variety of SQL commands tailored for the 'bank' database, providing hands-on experience. Dive in and start exploring!
